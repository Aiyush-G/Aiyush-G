I'm a multidisciplinary student whose won a global NASA competition, cycled the length of the UK, has had an audience of over 25K engineers / makers / hobbyists on my custom tool AnglEase on Instructables. I contribute to my school community by creating school magazines (The Word) after becoming proficient in Indesign, creating unique school websites and raising money for charity- over £2K. As well as becoming an anti-bullying ambassador for the Diana Award, school council member and as seen on interviews at BBC North-West and Manchester Radio. 

My passion is Computer Science and 3D Modelling where I have delivered lessons to students and teachers on Fusion360 in which I have completed multiple courses, I've created plugins on InDesign used by real publications. I'm currently setting up my own blog and love new opportunities.

Skills: Python / Tailwind / JS / HTML / CSS / Godot / Go
